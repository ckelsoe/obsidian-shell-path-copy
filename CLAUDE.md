# Instructions for Claude Code

## User Preferences

### Always Provide "Discuss First" Option
When presenting multiple choices or options to the user, ALWAYS include a 4th option to "Stop and discuss before proceeding". 

Example format:
1. Option A - Do something specific
2. Option B - Do something else  
3. Stop and wait - Wait for explicit instructions
4. **Let's discuss** - Talk through the pros/cons before deciding

The user has explicitly requested this and finds it frustrating when this option is not provided.
